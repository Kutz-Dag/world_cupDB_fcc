This was a project for freeCodeCamp. It involved creating a database of the Football World Cup 2014 and Football World Cup 2018.
Additionally, two files had to be created: one for inserting data and one for querying data.

## Project Instructions:

* Languages used: SQL and Bash Scripting
* The project is split into three parts
* The project must pass the required user stories

- [x] Part 1: Create the Database using SQL built on PostgreSQL (worldcup.sql)
- [x] Part 2: Insert the required data in a bash file (insert_data.sh)
- [x] Part 3: Query the data to pass the user stories in a separate bash file (queries.sh)
